== Description ==

Seamlessly integrates FancyBox into your blog: Upload, activate, and you're done. Additional configuration optional.

You can easily customize almost anything you can think about fancybox lightbox: the border, margin width and color, zoom speed, animation type, close button position, overlay color and opacity and even more advanced option like several options to group images into galleries, and more...

By default, the plugin will use jQuery to apply FancyBox to ANY thumbnails that link directly to an image. This includes posts, the sidebar, etc, so you can activate it and it will be applied automatically.

= Demo =

You can see the plugin working on a <a href="http://blog.moskis.net/2012/01/20/teclado-apple-en-windows-7/" target="_blank">this blog</a> although there's nothing amazing to see, just a FancyBox simple implementation, that's the point ;) You can take a look at the code if you're curious, though.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**- There was a vulnerability detected in versions 3.0.2 and lower, is my site in danger?**

This vulnerability was patched in version 3.0.3.

An additional change was introduced in version 3.0.4 to make sure that the malicious code can't be printed to visitors even if it still remains in the database.

If you think your site might still be using a vulnerable version of the plugin please log in to your WordPress admin panel, disable the plugin and clear any cache if your site uses a cache system.

If you wish to continue using the plugin, check that the plugin is updated to the latest version from your admin panel and enable it. Then check the plugin's settings page and make sure there's no abnormal code in any of the fields, especially on the Extra Calls tab. If you are not sure about the code you see in the settings please use the Revert to Defaults button at the bottom of the settings page.

If you think your site might be compromised in any other way check this guide: [WordPress Codex - FAQ My site was hacked](http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_My_site_was_hacked).

**- Is the FancyBox script vulnerable or unsafe?**

No, there's nothing wrong with the actual FancyBox script that i know of.

The vulnerability detected in versions 3.0.2 and lower of the "FancyBox for WordPress" plugin was limited to the plugin itself. Other FancyBox plugins or manual implementations of FancyBox are unrelated to this issue.
